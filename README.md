*NEATmap* is a toolbox for the semi-automatic analysis of volumetric data from [VISoR](https://github.com/BilabOptics/VISoR_code/).

*NEATmap's* tool box includes functional modules such as data preprocessing, neural network, post-processing, and quantization analysis.

## Background

*NEATmap* was designed to analyze volumetric images imaged by [VISoR](https://github.com/BilabOptics/VISoR_code/) light-sheet microscopy.

*NEATmap* tools can also be used to analyze data from other microscopy imaging, where neural networks can replace other networks that can be fed into the volumetric image.

## Application

*NEATmap* was developed to help researchers studying the brain field to be able to acquire data and analyze it efficiently and accurately (TB).

## Installation

NEATmap is written in Python 3 and is available for Windows and Linux systems.

The list of names of python libraries required by NEATmap can be found in the environment file `NEATmap.yaml`.
    
    $ conda env create -f NEATmap.yaml

Similarly, you can install other python dependencies via pip and use

    $ pip install name
